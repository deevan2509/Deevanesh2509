A central computer connected to remote terminals via communication links is used to automate seat reservations for a concert hall. A booking clerk can display the current state of reservations on the terminal screen. To book a seat, a client chooses a free seat, and the clerk enters the number of the chosen seat at the terminal and issues a ticket. A system is required that avoids double-booking of the same seat while allowing clients a free choice of the available seats. With relevant Java codes, design a solution to solve this problem.
